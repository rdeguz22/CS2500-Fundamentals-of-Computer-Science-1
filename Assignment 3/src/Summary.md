# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the
italicized instructions, as shown in the
[video](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d327c168-e0e8-4f70-9f3f-b12f0048baac).

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, to the best of your knowledge?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]
Yes, I successfully implemented everything that was requested to the best of my knowledge.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]
The assignment took around 4 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]
I worked with Douglas Conrad on figuring the syntax on the require() method and just what
questions were asking, more specifically the conditions needed for the functions attack() and battle(). I did not attend
any office hours.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which
tools you used and how you used them._ [2 points]
I used the slideshows from class, specifically
the September 18 slides for the syntax of the while loop. I also used
https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin/require.html to understand the syntax
of the require() method. I did not use AI to complete this assignment.

## Testing and debugging

_Describe your testing and debugging experience, including the following._

* What did you think of writing tests?
* Did you think of edge cases when writing tests that caused you to go back
  and change your implementation?
* Did your tests uncover bugs?
* What was your debugging process like?
* How confident are you in the correctness of your code?

_Your answer should be at least one full paragraph._ [5 points]
I thought of writing tests as part of the process. I didn't mind it because
it showed me whether or not my function worked. I did think of edge cases when writing tests,
which caused me to go back and change some implementation. My tests uncovered that my isAlive
variable wasn't working correctly at first, which led me to change it. I am somewhat confident in the
correctness of my code. It runs, but I have a feeling that I may have missed an edge case somewhere.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of the assignment was making the tests and figuring out
edge cases. I had to write out the Mobs I needed to make for a specific edge case.
The most rewarding part of the assignment was seeing a function run. More specifcally,
seeing the attack() function run because the require() function is supposed to throw an
IllegalArgumentException when a condition isn't met and running tests and getting the error got very
frustrating. So when I figured out how to know if a case won't pass, I felt very rewarded.
I learned how to correctly use a while loop and more about nesting loops. I also learned
to think about edge cases and scenarios where the function might fail to give the
correct output.
