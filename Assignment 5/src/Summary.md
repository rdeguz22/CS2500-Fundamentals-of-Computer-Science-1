# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the italicized
instructions.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, to the best of your knowledge?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

Yes.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

3 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]

Pair Programming with Douglas Conrad. We did not attend office hours.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which
tools you used and how you used them._ [2 points]

I used https://blog.droidchef.dev/remove-duplicates-from-a-list-in-kotlin/
and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2790813/regular-expression-a-za-z-or-a-za-z
for useful functions. I did not use AI.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of the assignment was implementing the makeSnippet() function
because it was conceptually difficult for me to understand what it asked for.
Once I understood its purpose and function, the implementation was much easier.
Implementing the final getSearchResults() function and using simulateWebServer() was the most rewarding part
of the assignment because I got to see the web crawler actually run after all of my work on the assignment
and because I got to use new helpful functions to complete it.
During this assignment, I got more comfortable with sets and lists, learned how to manage URI and the web pages,
learned about servers, and used many new and helpful functions to complete the assignment.
