# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the italicized
instructions.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, to the best of your knowledge?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

Yes.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

2 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]

Pair Programming with Ricardo DeGuzman. I did not attend office hours.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which
tools you used and how you used them._ [2 points]

We used the links and helpful tips in the assignment, Piazza, and previous lecture slides. We did not use AI.

## Testing and debugging

_Describe your testing and debugging experience, including the following._

* What did you think of writing tests?
* Did you think of edge cases when writing tests that caused you to go back
  and change your implementation?
* Did your tests uncover bugs?
* Were there bugs (mistakes) in your tests?
* What was your debugging process like?
* How confident are you in the correctness of your code?

_Your answer should be at least one full paragraph._ [5 points]

Writing tests was not difficult as I followed the same structure for each test of different lengths.
There were no edge cases that I could think of to apply to my tests.
My tests did uncover bugs in my code like uppercase and lowercase lettering of which I went back and changed.
My debugging process was not difficult, and it consisted of simple problems that I could fix right away.
I am very confident in the correctness of my code.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of the assignment was implementing correct syntax in creating functions. It wasn't so much about
approaching on how to make a function, it was more about coding the function. The most rewarding part of the assignment
was definitely seeing the program work. It took a good amount of going back to the slides and resource links to get this
assignment done. I learned how to use lists, more specifically how to select a random element. I also gained some
valuable experience with using while loops.
