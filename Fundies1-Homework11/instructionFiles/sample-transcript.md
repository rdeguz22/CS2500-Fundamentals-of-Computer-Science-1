I ASKED MY WIFE WHAT SHE WOULD LIKE FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT. SHE SAID, ANYTHING WITH DIAMONDS IN IT.

So I bought her a pack of cards.

YSK WE WILL BE MORE STRONGLY ENFORCING RULE 2

Up until now we have been pretty lenient in regards to Rule 2, which states that post must describe *why*  the YSK is useful. We have approved posts that didn’t state why the  knowledge is useful under the guise that its usefulness was implied.  However, due to an increasing number of these types of posts, we feel it  needs to be addressed. Therefore, starting now we will be enforcing  Rule 2 more heavily. All posts must include (in the text body) an  explicit statement of why the post is useful. Even if you think the  reasoning is obvious, you still must explicitly state it. This should be  done by having a simple “**Why YSK:**” in the text body. (Just for those who might not know, the text body is the area where you can put additional text after the title text when creating a post.) *Please note that it should go in the text body -- not the title or the comments.*

Remember that this sub is focused on self-improvement on how to do things, improve on activities, skills, and other tasks.

*BASICALLY:*

* All posts must include a "**Why YSK:**" (typed just like that) section in the text body.

\[\[Additionally, we want to take this time to remind everyone that [r/YouShouldKnow](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/)  is not a place to share personal stories or anecdotes. If you feel your  post needs to include one, a brief anecdote is fine. The entire (nor the majority of the) post should not be about your own personal experience, however. We will be removing posts that are just personal anecdotes.\]\]

**Why YSK:** We (the YouShouldKnow moderators) hope it will improve readers' abilities to better understand the purpose of the sub, mentioned above and in the expanded Rule 1. For thread creators, it will help in their ability to explain how the reader can improve upon a certain skill, task, or ability. It will also help the creator improve upon the skill of not having their post deleted due to not including "**Why YSK**" in the text body of their post.

*NOTES:*

* Bolding the words **Why YSK:** will make it a lot easier for people to find it.
* Again, please put **Why YSK** in bold letters. It's easier to find in a sea of text.
* **Why YSK** must be followed by an actual explanation as to how it helps someone improve upon a skill, task, or activity. Following it with a massive personal anecdote is not the point -- neither is following it with "I think this is important" or something similar.

YSK HEADPHONES ARE COLLECTING MORE PERSONAL DATA THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT AND CAN BE A PRIVACY RISK

Why YSK: Headphones are capable of tracking and collecting personal data, especially those that come with apps. Some models, including those marketed to children, have hidden spyware features that monitor user activity AND location (meaning, they can collect everything you listen to, where you go, and when). And this information is easily accessible by anyone who knows what they're doing.
