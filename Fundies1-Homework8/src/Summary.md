# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the brackets with
the point count.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]
Yes, I successfully implemented everything that was requested.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]
The assignment took about 2 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. **Please explicitly state (yes or no)** whether you attended any
office hours, and mention any TAs who were especially helpful._ [1 point]
I worked with Douglas Conrad as a pair programmer. I did not attend office hours.

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._ [1 point]
I did not use AI.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful_ [1 point]
I used the slides from class and the kotlin library to guide me through the functionality
and usage of the higher order functions. More specifically, some of the URLs that I used were
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html, https://kotlinlang.org/docs/collection-filtering.html, https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/sorted-by.html,
https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/any.html,https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/all.html,
and https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/count.html.

## Functional Programming

### What do you think of functional programming?

_What do you like or dislike about it? Had you used it before? Would you like to
use it again?_ [3 points]

Functional programming to me seems much more efficient and easier, however conceptually it's
a little harder to understand. I had never used it before this course. I would like to use it again.

### Debugging

_What was your debugging process like? For example, did you use the debugger or
print statements? Did the tests help you find bugs?_ [2 points]

Making new tests helped find bugs. I used print statements rather than the debugger.
Debugging took a significant amount of time in the assignment.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of the assignment was the debugging both the Minecraft exercises and the Wordle, I had to make
new test functions
and spent lots of time working out how to solve problems. The most rewarding part of the assignment
was seeing "All tests passed" after spending a long time debugging. I learned more about using functional programming
and higher order functions,
as well as improving my debugging skills.
