# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the italicized
instructions.

## Transcripts

Paste transcripts into the below sections. Put each within triple back-quotes,
like this:

```
This is an example.

All transcripts should start with the first text output from the program.
Provide a transcript even if your code did not work correctly. **Do not** modify
transcripts.

### Transcript 2

_Paste in the transcript for Problem 3, Step 7. It should show that a spider
spawner cannot spawn spiders when there is no empty adjacent space._

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work._ [1 point]
Yes I successfully implemented everything that was requested.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]
This assignment took about 3 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 point]
I worked with Douglas Conrad as a pair programmer. I did not attend any office hours.

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._ [1 point]
I did not use any AI.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful._ [2 points]
I only used the slides and notes that I took in class.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._
[4 points]
The most difficult part of the assignment was debugging and making sure the overridden functions worked in each class.
The most rewarding part of the assignment was being able to visibly see our code work. I learned more about how to
implement interfaces and overridden functions.
