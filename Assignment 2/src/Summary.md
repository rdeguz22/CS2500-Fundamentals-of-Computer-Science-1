# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the
italicized instructions, as shown in the
[video](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d327c168-e0e8-4f70-9f3f-b12f0048baac).

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, to the best of your knowledge?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass._ [1 point]
Yes, I implemented everything that was requested to the best of my knowledge.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]
The assignment took roughly 3 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]
I worked with Douglas Conrad and asked him about the syntax of the when statement (as I kept
forgetting the last line being an else), clarification on number 2 (more specifically what the purpose
of creating constants is and the purpose of MIN_AGE_FOR_PERSONALIZATION), and had him make sure
that I kept on task rather than get distracted.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which ones were
particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which tools you used and how
you used them._ [2 points]
I used https://kotlinlang.org/docs/enum-classes.html,
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html,
and https://kotlinlang.org/docs/control-flow.html to follow
syntax and learn about the differences between enum classes and data classes.
I did not use any AI in the process of completing this exercise.

## Thoughts on Targeted Ads

_Write an essay of two or more full paragraphs addressing all the following questions
and justifying your answers._

* What do you think of the targeted ads you receive? Do they seem accurate and helpful?
* How do you feel about your demographics being used for ad targeting?
* What about your health information, location history, browsing behavior, and social
  network?
* Should advertisers be able to include or exclude people based on their demographics,
  health information, browsing behavior, etc.?
* Does it matter if the advertising is for consumer goods or more sensitive areas, such as
  housing or employment opportunities?

_If you use AI or automated tools (beyond a spell checker) to write your answer, explicitly
disclose your usage._ [5 points]

I think the targeted ads that I receive are a pretty accurate representation of what I shop/search for on the web.
They're helpful in influencing me to make a decision in taking action on something that I didn't want to do or
purchasing something that I was still deciding on.
I don't have a strong opinion either way on my demographics being used for ad targeting because while yes, it is in some
case an invasion of privacy, I'm also agreeing to share my data when I accept cookies and even use software. I feel like
using health information and location history is a complete invasion of privacy. However, I believe browsing
behavior and social network are fair to use since I believe that those aren't as private and more public as people can
usually see your network and browsing collects and stores data for future reference.

I believe advertisors should be able to include or exclude people based on their demographics, health information, and
browsing behavior because it can help someone find resources. I think it does not matter if the advertising
is for consumer goods or areas such as housing or employment opportunities.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* Did all the tests from the pre-exercise pass the first time they ran?
  (Usually tests don't all pass.) What was the debugging process like?
* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome._

All the tests from the pre-exercise did not pass the first time they ran.
The debugging process was a rough one because I had to create the fetchAd() function from scratch like 3 times.
It was very time consuming because I wasn't clear on the purpose of the constants used in number 2. And it just took me
a while to
figure out the function. The most difficult part of the assignment was debugging and then coming up with code that would
compile correctly
for the fetchAd() function. The most rewarding part was getting through the difficulty of debugging the fetchAd()
function. I learned
about the difference between enum and data classes, the proper syntax for when statements, and more comfortability
coding with Kotlin.
